# Kavu

> Named after the കാവ് (kavu), the sacred groves of Kerala: small, protected, deliberately overgrown.

A monospace, terminal-inspired Hugo theme for digital gardens and personal knowledge bases. Designed around the principles of interconnected note-taking, with support for note maturity stages, network graph visualization, and dense cross-linking.

**Live site**: [stultus.in/notes](https://stultus.in/notes/)

## Note Maturity

Notes use a `status` frontmatter field to indicate maturity:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `seeding` | Stub or rough idea |
| `growing` | Developed draft, partially linked |
| `evergreen` | Polished, well-linked, stable understanding |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Add as a submodule
git submodule add git@github.com:stultus/kavu.git themes/kavu
```

Set in `hugo.toml`:
```toml
theme = "kavu"
themesdir = "./themes"
```

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Your Note Title"
date: 2025-01-01
lastmod: 2025-01-15
draft: false
tags: ["topic-a", "topic-b"]
summary: "One-line description of the note."
status: "seeding"  # seeding | growing | evergreen
type: "note"       # note | essay | moc | source
---
```

### Internal Links

Use absolute paths for internal links to ensure the theme's link resolver works correctly:

```markdown
[Note Title](/notes/note-slug/)
```

## Theme credit

Kavu renders a small "Built with Kavu by stultus" line in the footer by default. If you'd rather not include it, set in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
  hideThemeCredit = true
```

Keeping it on is appreciated — it helps other people find the theme.

## Origin

Kavu was originally forked from [paulmartins/hugo-digital-garden-theme](https://github.com/paulmartins/hugo-digital-garden-theme), which was inspired by [Maggie Appleton's website](https://maggieappleton.com/). It has since been substantially rewritten with a new design system, homepage, note pages, tag system, network graph, and CSS architecture.
